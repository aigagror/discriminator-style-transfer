## About
Performs style transfer by using a neural network to discriminate between the style image features and the generated image features. 
Results yield higher quality transfers than contemporary methods. 

#### Includes PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations
This codebase features both a PyTorch and Tensorflow implementation, 
which can be viewed in the branches `pytorch` and `tensorflow` respectively.
The `tensorflow` version is more up to date and recommended.
